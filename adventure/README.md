The goal of this lab is to create your own adventure game!

## Background

A popular example of a text based adventure game is Oregon Trail, a game originally developed in 1974. It's purpose was to teach school children about the realities of 19th century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. The player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding his party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley over the Oregon Trail via a Conestoga wagon in 1848. The game has been released in many editions since the original release by various developers and publishers who have acquired rights to the game.
