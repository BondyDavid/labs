# Pair Programming Project

## Getting Ready

For this project, you will work with a partner, using the pair programming protocol described in class. You will create a program using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The program should be at least as complex as the Skittles program below.

Skittles is a guess the number type game. It might respond something like this, but you can customize it to be your own. If you want to push yourself, you can add clues like, you are getting warmer, you are getting colder, etc.

You can re-create Skittles, or if you prefer, you may propose another project. Perhaps you would like to create a Caesar Cipher as a web page!

If you choose to create Skittles you will need to do the following:

1. Create an text box, a button and results div in HTML
1. Create a random number in JavaScript
1. Add an event listener to your button. Once clicked you should get the value from the input text box, compare it to the random number you generated, and add HTML to your results div that tells the user if they are too low, too high or just right!
Thatâ€™s Skittles!
