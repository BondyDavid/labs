# Hello, HTML (aka </Unit 5>)

## Getting Ready

Beyond introducing you to web programming, the overarching goal of this problem is to empower you to teach yourself new languages so that you can stand on your own at the end of the year. We’ll guide you through each, but if you nonetheless find yourself Googling and asking lots of questions of classmates and staff, rest assured you’re doing it right!

First consider joining Daven for a tour of HTML.

And consider reviewing some of David’s examples. There are a lot of videos here, so don’t feel like you have to watch them all if you are comfortable with the topics they cover!

# Ready to Start?

Hopefully, you should now be ready to go! Your assignment is simply to create a web page. You should have one HTML file (named whatever you’d like, it does not need to be index.html) containing the web page’s structure, and one CSS file for styling. Other than that, there are no restrictions on other things you’d like to include.

Feel free to be creative with this assignment. Make something that is meaningful to you - it could be a blog post, a pseudo-shopping website, or a family tree. The sky is the limit! At the bare minimum, your page MUST include the following:

* A table

* A link to an external website

* A button (which needn’t actually have a function, but should exist on the page)

* At least two divs, with div IDs

* A list

* A heading

* A paragraph

* At least three images, either externally linked or contained within your ~/workspace/unit5 directory

* At least one block of text that is not left-aligned

* At least two different fonts

* At least three different colors of text

* At least two other extra features, one in HTML and one in CSS

* Of course, you can do many more of each of the above; and to make a neat website, you’ll have to!

Because this assignment will result in something different for each person, there’s no check50 for this one. Make sure that you’ve included everything listed above and you have no broken links or permission issues and you should be good to go.
