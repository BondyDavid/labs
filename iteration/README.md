## What to do?

In this lab you will solve nine different problems using different types of loops!

* Print out every number 1-100
* Print out every number from 50-100
* Print out every even number from 1-100
* Print out every square number 1-100
* Print out every multiple of three
* Print out every number that ends in a 7 from 7-1007
* Solve FizzBuzz<sup>1</sup>
* Print out the first 40 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
* Find the sum of every integer from 1-1000

[1] Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz!
