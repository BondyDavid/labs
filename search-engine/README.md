# Create Your Own Search Engine

## Getting Ready

Ok, so you won’t be building an entire search engine from scratch, but a front-end to google search. You can style it, customize it, make it your own! It’s still pretty cool!

Watch David’s videos below and follow along in this lab. He explains and types in the code to create a form and make a get request to google. You can follow along in cloud9 to create your own form and get request, and then style it using css.

First is the lecture video from last fall, where he develops his code in cs50.io. Starting at the 1:18:29 point, until about 1:23:18, he builds a search engine front end. After this he demonstrates using CSS to style his page.

These short videos below, break down the process a bit further. These were created before CS50 used cloud9 or sandbox remember to use http-server for previewing.
