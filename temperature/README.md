# Temperature

## Turning Up The Heat, Again!

For this problem, you will create a web page to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and/or Celsius to Fahrenheit.

You will need to use HTML, CSS and of course JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. create a form in the body section of your html
1. create an input element in the form with type=”text” where the user will enter degrees. Make sure to use a unique id to be able to get the element’s value in JavaScript
1. create an input element with type="submit" to be able to submit your form
1. create a JavaScript function that is called when you submit your form, to calculate the conversion and display it. 

{% next %}

## Now Extend it

Once you have your web page working, let's make it look really nice! 

First of all, add your converted result to the DOM rather than using a JavaScript alert. It will look more professional.

Add some CSS to style it, and perhaps add pictures to make it more appealing.

You may want to go even further and create a page that calculates both Fahrenheit to Celsius AND Celsius to Fahrenheit. You may want to use an HTML select tag to create a pull down menu to determine which way to do the conversion. Or perhaps radio buttons to determine which way to convert. 

Make this we page easy to use and personalize it.
