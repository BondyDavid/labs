# Temperature

## Turning Up The Heat, Again!

For this problem, you will create a web page to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and/or Celsius to Fahrenheit.

You will need to use HTML, CSS and of course JavaScript. In HTML you must:

1. create a form in the body section of your html
1. create an input element in the form with type=”text” where the user will enter degrees. Make sure to use a unique id to be able to get the element’s value in JavaScript
1. create an input element with type="submit" to be able to submit your form
1. create a JavaScript function that is called when you submit your form, to calculate the conversion and display it 

## How to Submit

Execute the below, logging in with your GitHub username and password when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your password.
