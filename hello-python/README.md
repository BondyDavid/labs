## Hello, Python!

If you've taken CS50 Intro this year, you've already created Hello in C. If you haven't, no worries, just ignore the C code referenced here. In either case, will be writing what might be your first Python program!

{% next %}

You will write your hello program in the file to the right, hello.py. Since Python is an interpreted language, there is no need to compile! To run your code, simply type in 

```
python hello.py
```
in the lower terminal window.
